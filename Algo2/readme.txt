Iteration: go through elements one by one
Recursive: process current node and then handle sub problem. DFS, DP and Backtracking are based on recursive.

BackTracking: for loop, then select, solve the sub problem and deselect
Dp: 1) define status meaning 2) find tranfer formula, 3)prepare base case
Traverse: travel each element

BFS: use queue to travel each element
DFS: use recursive to travel each element
